## Summary

I've been in the Information Technology sector since the early 1990's. During my time I've dealt with customers covering everything from Y2K concerns, certification paths, Identity Management and most recently custom automation. My team is currently responsible for handling the automation for internal processes within the Rackspace public cloud offerings. I'm mainly responsible for the development of API's and PowerShell modules.
