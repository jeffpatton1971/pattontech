Welcome to my website, this site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I have run this site on several platforms, [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), and while those were all very good, ultimately none of them were ever really in my wheelhouse. What I mean is that I write a lot of [code](https://activity-graph.herokuapp.com/graph?username=jeffpatton1971) and tend to typically be inside either [vsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) routinely. It made sense to me to just combine the IDE and Github into a single experience.
