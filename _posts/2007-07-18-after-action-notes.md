Problems:

* All computers need to be configured to PXE boot
* Dell Precision 390 desktops need to have SATA configured for ATA operation in order for RIS to work
* Updated RIS images need to be modified to have the Broadcom 57xx driver
* RIS has a limitation on the master image machine, if the drive is larger than the drive on the destination computer the image wonâ€™t deploy even if there is enough room on the destination computer.

Thoughts:

* Planning for the future, Vista can only be deployed via WDS
* Convert RIS to WDS on Server 2003
* Compare Windows Server 2003 WDS with the Windows Deployment Role in Windows Server 2008
* Extract MAC addresses from all SOECS computers from ANSR
* Create a script to manage DHCP
  * Bring DHCP online for deployment
  * Bring DHCP offline after deployment
