Still bringing services online after our recent hardware upgrade, today’s goal was to make DPM 2007 go. The original server was a PoiwerEdge 1950 with a MD1000 attached. It was populated with 15 750gb drives and housed all of our backup data. As both the server and drive array were falling off warranty we took this opportunity to purchase a new PowerEdge server, but we opted for a PromiseArray with 16 2TB drives.

DPM Server is running Windows 20008 R2, the OS installation went fine, there are several tutorials out there, I followed the one from the [Core Team](http://blogs.technet.com/askcore/archive/2008/06/18/how-to-install-data-protection-manager-to-a-windows-2008-server.aspx). There is one thing that you will need to change though in order to get reporting to work properly.

Error Message:

``` dos
DPM could not connect to SQL Server Reporting Services server because of IIS connectivity issues.

On the computer on which the DPM database was created, restart the World Wide Web Publishing Service. On the Administrative Tools menu, select Services, Right-click World Wide Web Publishing Service, and then click Start.
```

ID: 3013.

This message is due to the new security features, I found this [article](http://www.bloggersbase.com/computers/restoring-data-protection-manager-dpm-database-onto-a/) extermely helpful for 2008 R2.
