Well it's been a busy week for sure, two days wrapped up in [Microsoft Interviews]({ post_url 2022-03-09-microsoft-interviews }) and I'll be blunt, I wasn't selected, but this is the furthest I've gone in a Microsoft interview, so I was pretty excited about that. While that was going on I was also doing actual work, sorting out [Github Actions]({ post_url 2022-03-10-github-actions }) as well as a fair amount of template work both in the [MultiCloudDeployment](https://github.com/MultiCloudDeployment) project, but I've also decided to re-organize the [ArmReference](https://github.com/ArmReference) project to really be more workable and provide more examples as well as getting documentation put in as well.

Have a wonderful weekend!
