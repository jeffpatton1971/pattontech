[Yesterday](2012-04-10-weekly-dpm-monitoring.md) I told you how I had decided to automate a portion of my DPM routine. As usual this got the fires burning and a second script was born. I would have told you about it yesterday but I wanted to make the appearance of doing actual work ðŸ˜‰

So today I give you the [Get-DPMSizingValues.ps1](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971/mod-posh/blob/master/powershell/production/Get-DPMSizingValues.ps1) script. This is basically the portion of the DPM Sizing tool that I use regularly, the part that deals with file servers. I must say Iâ€™m rather proud of it as it worked out better than I thought it would. It uses some of the same basic stuff as the previous script, which was nice for me.

My [Get-PSDrive](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd315263.aspx) statement is a little different. I noticed when I ran this against my Windows 7 machine I had a lot of cruft I didnâ€™t care about, so youâ€™ll note the [Where-Object](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd315399.aspx) bit. That filters out any results that have less than or no used space.

``` powershell
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem |Where-Object {$_.Used -gt 0} |Select-Object -Property Name, @{Label='Used';Expression={$_.Used /1gb}}
```

The nitty gritty part of it uses the same formula found in the spreadsheet. Now, there are some values that are hard-coded as these are direct from Microsoft and I donâ€™t really know what they mean as they have not been terribly forthcoming about it, or my fu is just not working for me today.

``` powershell
if (($ReplicaOverheadFactor/100) -gt 1)
{
    $ReplicaVolume = $VolumeIdentifier.Used * ($ReplicaOverheadFactor/100)
    }
else
{
    $ReplicaVolume = $VolumeIdentifier.Used * 1.5
    }

if ($VolumeIdentifier.Used -gt 0)
{
    $ShadowCopyVolume = ($VolumeIdentifier.Used * $RetentionRange * ($DataChange/100)) + (1600/1024)
    }
```

So I just found a bug while writing this and fixed it, turned out I forgot to convert the ReplicaOverheadFactor into a fraction in that first test. Oh well, itâ€™s working now which is good. At any rate, that is the heart of the script, that gets looped through for every drive that has used space. I had thought about not doing the second test, since my scriptblock actually shouldnâ€™t return any volumes that have zero used space, but what the heck, it doesnâ€™t hurt anything.

The resulting output is pretty nifty, I would imagine you could potentially pipe this into dpm cmdlet, but I havenâ€™t verified that. If someone needs it Iâ€™ll look into doing that but for now, itâ€™s a very nice little reporting tool that will give you calculated values for Replica Volumes and ShadowCopy Volumes.

``` powershell
Name            : C
UsedSpace       : 44.3877143859863
Retention       : 7
Replica         : 53.2652572631836
ShadowCopy      : 32.6339000701904
DataChange      : 10
ReplicaOverhead : 120
```

There is also a version on the [Technet Gallery](http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Get-DPMSizingValuesps1-cdbfe9f9)(Gallery is no longer active).
