Not really a whole lot to say here, just really happy that my backup of user data is complete! It has taken about a month to get a successful backup and now that I have one, I’m not really sure what to do next!

Ok, that’s not really true, I do know what I need to work on next, it’s just no fun. We have no end of problems with DPM and the tape-drive. So the next task is to get the tape backups going for long term archival.
