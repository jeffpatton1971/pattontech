Delay:

There was a delay of over two weeks while we waited for NTS to agree on a time to monitor the impact of a test deployment on the network at large.

Results:

I have no concrete numbers on how things went, but there were 13 machines in the test. The first machine started at 3:10pm and reached a logon prompt at 3:37pm. The image was a base install of Windows XP with Service Pack 2, the size of the image on the server is pretty small, but in the grand scheme the amount of overall data I donâ€™t think is as important, as that will only impact the length of time.
