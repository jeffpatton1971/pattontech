After writing the script that generates the lab usage report, I looked at the BuildArray procedure and decided to change it to be more generic. This would allow me to use it in different ways.

The [QueryAD](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971/mod-posh/blob/master/vbs/playground/procedures/QueryAD.txt) procedure is a very simple script that loops through a recordset of objects returned from the Active Directory. The procedure uses the strQuery variable to represent your LDAP query.

This procedure accepts one parameter:

strQuery
The strQuery parameter represents the Active Directory query you wish to perform and should look similar to the following:

``` visualbasic
strQuery = "SELECT " & strPropertyList & " FROM ‘" & strLDAPURL & "‘ WHERE objectClass = ‘" & strObjectClass & "‘"
```

I have shown the assignment using variables to represent the significant portions of the query, you could certainly manually build the query, but this format allows for much more flexibility.
