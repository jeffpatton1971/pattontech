Welcome to another Friday! Congratulations you made it!

Well it's been a week for sure, perhaps one of the more interesting things I did was decide to refactor how the [Multicloud Framework](https://github.com/MultiCloudDeployment/framework) should work. I [wrote about this]({% post_url 2022-02-16-language-parsing %}) earlier this week, but the gist of it is Framework shouldn't have to have it's own templates it should leverage the existing cloud native templates available and simply process those.

The bulk of that work will involve reading and learning to work with [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) which will be the first time in a long time that I'll dig into learning something new. The last time that happened was when I [transitioned my VBS to PowerShell]({% post_url 2011-04-03-powershell %})! We'll see how that goes.

I have also slowly gotten back into the swing of writing, which has been something in the back of mind to get back into for some time now, so it's been nice getting these things down.
