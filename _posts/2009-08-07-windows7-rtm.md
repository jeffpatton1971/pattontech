So this is not really related to work, but Windows 7 RTM’d the other day and both my Technet Subscription and Windows 7 Beta downloads became available today! I’ve been running Windows 7 since Beta 1 on my personal laptop a Toshiba Satellite L25, so I’m really looking forward to the RTM. While it does mean another wipe and reload at least all the debugging stuff will be gone so I should see a bit of a performance boost!

The downloads are very slow, the connect download is averaging 18.5KB/sec, so it will be done sometime next week! The Technet download is going a lot faster at 180KB/sec but still very slow! I will certainly post when they’re done and my install experiences!
