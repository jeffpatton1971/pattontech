At first I thought I had a drinking problem. As evidence by the picture below, I drink A LOT of coffee!

Then as I’m driving in to work I’m listening to NPR. They are talking about the [health rankings](http://www.kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/kansas-continues-struggle-health-rankings) for Kansas, apparently it’s an annual report of the state of the health system for a given state. As I’m listening to this I find myself thinking, where did they pull their data from? I wonder if I could get at that data? I could easily write a Management Pack to monitor….holy crap!

Yes, I found myself roughing out how I would write a Management Pack in Operations Manager to report on the state of the health system.

Hello, my name is Jeff. I see the world in varying states of health Green (Happy), Yellow (Unhappy) and Red (Angry).
