This afternoon I imported all my stubs into the vbs link above. On the way home I thought it would be really nice if I had tagged them initially to make it easier to search and so on. So this evening after dinner I started working on tagging each stub, and had some problems early on that I think are related to adding a revision note. I haven’t really worked that out yet, but long story short, tags are done! For now…
