## Introduction

In modern application development, managing secrets and sensitive configuration data is crucial. Azure Key Vault provides a secure and efficient way to store these sensitive values. In this article, we'll explore how to integrate Azure DevOps pipelines with Azure Key Vault using templates and variable groups.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure DevOps project set up with appropriate permissions.
- An Azure Key Vault with secrets you want to access in your pipelines.
- Basic knowledge of YAML and Azure DevOps pipelines.

## Using Variable Groups with Azure Key Vault

Variable groups in Azure DevOps allow you to define a set of variables that can be reused across multiple pipelines. When combined with Azure Key Vault, you can securely store and reference sensitive information.

### Creating a Variable Group

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
2. Go to `Pipelines` > `Library` > `Variable groups`.
3. Click on `+ Variable group` to create a new group.
4. Add variables and their values, leaving the sensitive ones empty.

### Linking Variable Groups to Key Vault

To access secrets from Azure Key Vault in your pipelines, you'll need to link your variable groups:

1. In the Azure DevOps project, go to `Pipelines` > `Library` > `Variable groups`.
2. Select the variable group you created earlier.
3. Click on `Link secrets from an Azure key vault as variables`.
4. Choose your Azure subscription and Key Vault.

Now, your variable group is linked to the Key Vault, allowing you to reference secrets in your pipeline.

For more detailed information, refer to the official documentation on [Variable Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops).

## Integrating Azure Key Vault with Pipelines

Azure Key Vault integration with Azure DevOps pipelines allows you to securely store and use sensitive information in your CI/CD process. To learn more about this integration, refer to the official documentation on [Azure Key Vault integration in Release pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/azure-key-vault?view=azure-devops).

## Using Templates for Code Reusability

Azure DevOps templates provide a way to define reusable, parameterized pipeline configurations. When combined with variable groups and Key Vault, you can streamline your CI/CD process.

### Creating a Template

Create a new YAML file in your repository (e.g., `azure-pipeline-template.yml`). This template will define the structure of your pipeline and accept parameters for customization.

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: environment
    displayName: 'Environment'
    type: string
    default: 'dev'

  - name: buildConfiguration
    displayName: 'Build Configuration'
    type: string
    default: 'Release'

jobs:
- job: BuildAndDeploy
  displayName: 'Build and Deploy Job'
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'

  steps:
  - script: |
      echo "Building for ${{ parameters.environment }} environment with configuration: ${{ parameters.buildConfiguration }}"
      # Add your build and deployment steps here
```

In this template, we define two parameters: `environment` and `buildConfiguration`. These parameters allow for customization when the template is used in a pipeline. Note how we reference the parameters using `${{ parameters.environment }}` and `${{ parameters.buildConfiguration }}`.

### Using the Template in a Pipeline

In your pipeline YAML file (e.g., `main-pipeline.yml`), reference the template and pass the desired values for the parameters. Additionally, declare your regular variables using name/value pairs.

```yaml
variables:
  - name: regularVariable
    value: 'This is a regular variable'

  - name: MyRegularVariable
    value: 'This is another regular variable'

  - group: 'MyVariableGroup'  # Reference to your variable group

trigger:
  branches:
    exclude:
      - '*'

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - '*'

jobs:
- template: azure-pipeline-template.yml
  parameters:
    environment: '

prod'
    buildConfiguration: 'Debug'
```

In the above example, the template is referenced, and the `environment` parameter is set to `'prod'` and `buildConfiguration` is set to `'Debug'`. Note how we have defined our Variables and Variable Group references, when including both in your Variable block you must reference un-grouped variables using name/value syntax, as defined in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#use-a-variable-group).
