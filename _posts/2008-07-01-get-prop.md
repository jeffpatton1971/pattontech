[GetProp](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971/mod-posh/blob/master/vbs/playground/functions/GetProp.txt) is a generic function that is used to return single-valued properties from objects in the Active Directory. If the property is empty it writes an entry to the application log via the LogData routine.

This function accepts two parameters:

strADSPath
strProperty
strADSPath
This is the DistinguishedName property of the object that we are working on. It is generated somewhere outside of this routine.

strProperty
This is just whatever single-valued property that we are looking for. A listing of all properties for Active Directory Objects can be found on the main page of this site.
