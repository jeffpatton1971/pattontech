It's been a minute and I apologize, last week was filled with meetings and interviews so been kind of busy with tedius work that I'm not a fan of. I did work on some Azure API Manamgment stuff so I think I'll post about that later this week once I have things more sorted. So hopefully in the next few days I'll kick something out that should be interesting.

Have a wonderful week!
