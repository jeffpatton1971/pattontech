I work with two developers, in order to reduce the amount of teasing I decided to modularize all of my code. I have several functions and subroutines that I am fairly proud of and will document their use here. All of the scripts will be freely available in my public [Scripts](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971/mod-posh/tree/master/vbs) folder.

If you have any questions donâ€™t hesitate to write, my contact information is available through my [profile](https://github.com/jeffpatton1971).
