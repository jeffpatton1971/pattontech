So I’ve spent the past few days working up a new theme for the site. I’ve been wanting something that looked similar to a newspaper, and I think I came pretty close.

I used the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/), [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/), and the [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/) as inspiration. I’m using some fonts that I found online. The site title font is [Wedding Text BT Regular](http://www.broble.com/download-free-font/wedding-text-bt/), the post title font is [Baker Signet BT Roman](http://www.broble.com/download-free-font/baker-signet-bt/) and the body of the site is [Baskerville Old Face Regular](http://www.broble.com/download-free-font/baskerville-old-face/).

I’ve been using [Blueprint CSS](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) since I moved off Drupal and have been very happy with it. I wouldn’t say that I’m an expert by any means but I’m getting pretty good at using it and understanding what I’m looking at.

I hope you enjoy it!
