Here we are another week in the books, and I've been super busy and just kind of forgot so I wanted to get this out real quick. It's been busy around here, and I've not done the work I wanted to do, but I did do the work that work wanted me to work on!

I thought I would jot down a few things that I tend to live by that I picked up from various folks that I've worked with.

## Keep It Simple Stupid

This is more or less an axiom and I don't know where I first picked this up, but I live by this one.

## Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance

This phrase I picked up from a manager that I had when I was with KU. This I believe was an old Navy saying, as he was an old Navy man. He was a wonderful man and I truly miss him.

## Lead, Inspire and Motivate

I picked this one up from an incredible project manager that I worked with here at Rackspace, I learned a great deal working with him and I really miss his energy level!

## Shave a lot of yaks

Literally just picked this one up, it means we all have some dirty work that we need to take care of, in fact when he said it, reminded me I needed to get something out!

Hope you have a great weekend!
