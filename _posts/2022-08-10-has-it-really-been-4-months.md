Well, here we are again, I'd apologize but sometimes real life takes a priority and there's nothing you can do about it. Since I last updated I've bought a new house, saw my daughter graduate high school, took a week vacation in a beach house, spent a month in Florida (working, mostly) and unpacked a hosue we hadn't lived in for more than a few weeks. I've been working on a lot of different projects at work and personally and a lot of them I think deserve a full break down, but we can do perhaps a quick summary.

### Multicloud Deployment
We last talked about this in depth in February, but it's been on my mind a lot. How to go from a class to terraform or arm or bicep. As you know a lot of this work is crossover for what I'm doing for my job, and two weeks ago I finally hit on a solution. I hope to be putting something together to really highlight this soon.

### GithubClient
This actually is something directly related to projects from work. I've released version 1.0.0 of this on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Patton.GithubClient/) and it is a little rough around the edges at the moment. But I'll be adding more methods to this library as I pick up more projects at work.

### Work
A lot of things going on here I've made some big improvements around the build automation that I've been responsible for for the better half of a year. While we've had nearly all the original members of the team leave, I've not yet given up.

That's a quick review of things going on with me, hope things are well with you all.
